TODO:

1) Handle all day vs. specifc appointments better (calculation of
   'days until' needs to take the difference into account). Trivial to
   do, I just ain't done it yet.

2) Handle multi-day events better (currently there is no end date
   given, and the 'days until' goes negative during the event). Again,
   should be easy.

3) Allow calendar information to be put in a config file.

4) Support multiple calendars properly.
